Reflection on your experience with this assignment:
# A0-ADT-for-Arrays

- Chiashi Yang: 
This assignment was definitely simpler than I thought it was going to be. Writing the JUnit tests in plain English helped me remember the process and terms. In addition, just focusing on the interface instead of writing the actual code was a great way to ease into the semester. I appreciated the reminders and flexibility with this assignment! My group and I were collaborative and worked out different parts of the assignment. I will say that I definitely need to study up on my Java, as I had trouble with some key terms and concepts.
